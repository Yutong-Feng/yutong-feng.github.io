# 😃 Welcome to My Academic Homepage!

<img align="right" src="images/photo.jpg" width="30%" height="29.5%"/>

Greetings! I am **Yutong Feng (冯雨橦)**, a dedicated researcher passionate about the intersection of data science and advanced technology. I'm currently pursuing an MPhil degree at [**Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) \[HKUST (GZ)\]**](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) within the [**Data Science and Analytics (DSA) Thrust**](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/data-science-and-analytics/), under the guidance of Prof. [**Yuxuan Liang**](https://yuxuanliang.com/) at [**CityMind Lab**](https://citymind.top/).

My academic journey began at the [**Guangzhou International Campus**](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/gzic/) of [**South China University of Technology (SCUT)**](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), where I studied [**Microelectronics**](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/microelectronics/main.htm) at [**Junde College (峻德书院)**](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/jdsy/main.htm). This formative experience equipped me with extensive knowledge in **Signal and System**, **Digital Signal Processing**, **Electromagnetic Analysis** (with a focus on **Vector Field Theory**), and **Digital Integrated Chip Design**, providing me with unique insights and expertise that I bring to the field of data science research.

My research interests orbit around the fusion of:
- **Spatio-Temporal Data Mining**, i.e., utilizing the models such as STGNN, Transformer or other advanced network architectures to identify the spatial and temporal dependencies between data, thereby facilitating more effective solutions to problems such as urban development, resource scheduling and scientific discovery.
- **Time Series Analysis**. My principal research interests lie in the fields of uncertainty estimation and the development of foundation models for multivariate time series.
- **Vector Database**, i.e., addressing the challenge of efficiently storing, indexing, and querying high-dimensional vector data, which is critical for applications like similarity search in large-scale spatio-temporal datasets. My research interest is in the development of models with reduced computational complexity and the capacity to handle larger data volumes (Database4AI). This approach has the potential to reduce training time and enhance inference efficiency.

<!-- My fervor lies in exploring innovative methodologies within these realms, seeking to unravel the complex interplay between data, cities, and technological advancements. -->

<!-- My aim is to leverage my multidisciplinary knowledge and skills to contribute meaningfully to the evolving landscape of data science, particularly in addressing challenges within urban environments. Through my academic pursuits, I endeavor to unravel complexities, forge connections between data points, and pioneer solutions that positively impact urban societies. -->

This website serves as a platform to share my academic endeavors, research contributions, and thoughts on the evolving domain of data-driven urban studies. I invite you to explore my work and insights as I navigate through the exciting realms of data science and its transformative potential within urban contexts.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to engaging with you on this academic journey.

Warm regards,

Yutong Feng

## UrbanNeXus:Advancing Cities through Intelligence & Innovation 
### Abstract
Urbanization has been a key aspect of societal development, leading us to an era where cities act as centers of innovation, culture, and opportunity. However, modern urban areas face complex challenges related to sustainability, data management, and citizen privacy. Conventional city infrastructures often struggle to utilize data effectively, impeding progress towards intelligent and sustainable urban ecosystems.

The **UrbanNeXus (UNX)** project is a response to pressing urban challenges. It aims to catalyze a paradigm shift in city functionality by introducing an urban computing platform designed explicitly for next-generation cities.

UrbanNeXus is a full-stack system that synergistically enhances urban sustainability, intelligence, and privacy. By seamlessly integrating these layers, UrbanNeXus aims to be the cornerstone of next-generation cities, fostering innovation and resilience in urban environments.
